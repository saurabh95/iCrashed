Idea:

The application aims to reduce the number deaths due to car accidents in which the help does not arrive at time.

This is android application that aims to inform the relatives/friends of a person who suffers an accident.

The application will have 2 modes (depending upon the type of road bumpy/highway).

He can preselect 3 contacts he wants to inform in case of emergency.
The application will send them a text message with the link of the accident site.

It does not require internet or gps to function.It needs only phone network connectivity.
